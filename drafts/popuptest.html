      “[...] not only is landscape the medium of naturally existing forces, flows and processes, but the very matter that constitutes landscape itself — the rocks, the soils, the fossils it produces — all add temporal, ecological and geological dimensionality to its vitality — its non-human agency. On the other hand, this agency, if well-documented in its materiality, can play a more interpretive role in constituting a kind of historical narrative of human culture — a means to prove the recent and deep past of the human condition in relation to objects extracted from or placed within the landscape. Taken together, these various discursive tendencies instigate a practice in which the rigorous documentation of materials, plants and their unique ecologies can be curated to reveal a kind of social and cultural agency that passes through the material fragments of landscape, entangling the human and non-human worlds in a complex, more-than-human ecology. Landscape, we could say, appears today as a kind of as-found archive of social and cultural history.”
